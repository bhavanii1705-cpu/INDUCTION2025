# INDUCTION 2025

# DAY 1 (31ST JULY)
My first day at college started by visiting gurudwara sahib located in the college campus.The shape of Gurudwara sahib was resembling to ship which teaches us that we all are in a jahaz or ship of waheguru/god.The atmosphere was positive and calm.After having kadah prasad,i went to the auditorium where we got our welcome kits.The stage was beatifully decorated for our welcome.After a period of time, we were introduced to the 2 successfull alumini through their motivational video message.The college has also completed their 70 glorious years.After this, we were addressed by respectful dignitaries of college :
DR.SEHAJPAL SINGH (PRINCIPAL), DR.HARPREET KAUR GREWAL (HoD, APPLIEAD SCIENCES), DR.AKSHAY GIRDHAR(DEAN ACADEMICS) were among them.their words felt like we were already a part of GNDEC family.
   Then came the chief guest ER.RAVINDER GARG who is the chief engineer at municipal corportation ludhiana.He taught us how with time everything is evolved and we need to work hard to achieve success.Following him is IInd chief guest ER.RAKESH KUMAR (ADC LUDHIANA) who was a a GNDEC alumunus of 1991 batch.His moral and ethical values left a deep impact in my mind.We were also taught about education loan,the terms and conditions required,the benefits one can avail etc.After the event in auditorium was over, we were taken to our alloted buildings where college faculty introduced themselves.DR.KIRAN JYOTI(HoD of CS) came and talked with us about how our hardwork,deication and skills will make us get good packages.We were informed about examinations,clubs,mentoring groups and other important information.We also visited the labs situated within our block.It felt very warmed and comfortable after interacting with college faculty.In this way the first day of college ended happily:)‚ò∫Ô∏è



# DAY 2(1ST AUGUST)  
## FOOD: A PIVOTAL ROLE IN STUDENTS'S WELLNESS
With the starting of day 2 at college,a new excitement and  hope to interact with new personalities also rose among me.With our arrival to college, two proficiency tests:
- **English Proficiency Test**
- **Mathematics Proficiency Test**
were conducted by our seniors so as to understand us and our intelligence.My english test went excellent but the same did not happen with Maths test, may be because all basic concepts of junior classes were brushed off from my memory.After both the tests were conducted, we were taken to the auditorium for the event.After about 30 minutes, all students were addressed by agents of NEHRU SIDHANT KENDER TRUST about their SATYA SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM 2025 where they have aimed to  provide service to atleast 50 needy students from the college.It was good what a great work they are doing to empower the future of india.Following them, DR.ARASHDEEP SINGH came and addressed us about why health is also important with studies.He educated us which type of food to eat and to avoid junk food for main meals of the day.He also adrressed to some most common rumours and myths related to food.His lecture was very much informative and useful for me.After his education, our seniors introduced us to GITHUB and MARKDOWN platforms for our activities and assignments submission.They explained every thing from account creation to commit changes in the file.I felt that our seniors  are very polite and respectful with us :-).With this, our 2nd day of college also came to an end..üòá



# DAY 3 (2ND AUGUST)
On 3rd day of college,we all visited to the auditorium to attend a very interesting and inspiring lecture of Dr.Jaswinder Singh(renowned for Jaswins's Lab on Wheels).He was such a good speaker and i loved his personality,the way he interacted with us,his speaking skills and all...He educated us with his maths skills about waheguru and ek onkar.Also by using his stuff, we learned  about life,patience, consistency and peace of life.He was very good in explaining all these concepts. One thought I learned from his session which still resides in my mind is that "We are here in college not to study,but to learn ".I hope he would take more sessions like this.After his session, we were introduced to our next speaker Dr.Priya Darshni who educated us about Universal Human Values.She said how nowadays we people are more into physical facilities instead of understanding and relationships,that we need to prioritise right understanding and relationships first than physical facilities.Moreover she educated us about how to control our anger, overthinking and stress.With so much learning from today's both sessions,we were reflected upon the results of proficiency tests by our seniors...With this,we concluded our 3rd day ‚ò∫Ô∏è
